                            Terrarium, also called glass garden, wardian case, or vivarium,  enclosure with glass sides, and sometimes a glass top. 
                            A terrarium is a self sustaining plant ecosystem that's calibrated to effectively replicate all the necessary natural cycles 
                            for a thriving community of organisms.
                            A healthy ecosystem is one that is sustainable that it has the ability to maintain its structure and function over 
                            time in the face of external stress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Terrarium Life, which is inspired by the idea of a terrarium, attempts to encourage everyone in the neighborhood 
                            to participate in an environmental movement by maintaining a healthy ecosystem.
                            Maintaining the ecosystem can be done by practicing zero waste, utilizing recycled materials, and sealing our surroundings 
                            with vegetation. Letâ€™s preserve our life, preserve our ecosystem.

                            <h3>Waste Management</h3>
                            <p>
                                Waste management is the process of handling and disposing of various types of waste, from household garbage to industrial waste. 
                                Waste management aims to reduce the environmental and health impacts of waste, as well as to recover valuable resources
                                from it. Waste management methods include recycling, composting, incineration, landfills, bioremediation, waste to energy, and waste minimization.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Recycling</h3>
                            <p>
                                Recycling is the process of breaking down and reusing materials that would otherwise be thrown away as trash of materials from consumed products. 
                                There are two types of recycling, internal and external. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Internal recycling is the reuse in a manufacturing process of materials that are a waste product of that process, and is common in the metals 
                                industry (see scrap metal). External recycling is the reclaiming of materials from a product that is worn out or no longer useful; an example is 
                                the collection of old newspapers and magazines for the manufacture of newsprint or other paper products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Recycling is ideal for the disposal of inorganic waste such as plastic, glass, and metals. Though organic waste such as paper and food can also be 
                                recycled, composting would be a better waste disposal method as it converts organic waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer.

                                Compost is organic matter that has been decomposed in a process called composting. This process recycles various organic materials such as leaves 
                                and food scraps, decomposes into soil. 
                                Compost can be prepared on a small scale for home gardens, usually in a simple pile of yard waste and kitchen scraps, though compost bins 
                                and barrels are also used.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are three stages in composting:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Compost goes through the mesophilic stage, where decomposition speeds up and produces heat.</li>
                                    <li>Next is the thermophilic phase, featuring high temperatures and the further breakdown of organic wastes.</li>
                                    <li>Last is the curing stage, where compost cools and matures.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
